%%%%Currently used for documenting development of R Tools%%%%%%%%%
================High Priority Tools====================================

UserinSplit: Gets the group assignment info for each student.

(Video first access time)

================Proposed Analysis Tools Waiting To Be Developed=================

GetWhen.nthAttempt: Given a list of problems and a list of students, return a dataframe containing the time at which the nth attempt is made. (Note: whether the attempt is correct can be retrieved from the response matrix, and added to result)

need: student.nid, problem info for problem-item correspondence, a list of problems.  


GetCorrectWhen.OneStudent: Given one problem id and one student id, return a dataframe containing all the attempts the student made on this problem, whether it is correct or not and when each attempt was made.

GetCorrectWhen.OneProblem:  Given one problem id, a list of student ids, and specify the nth attempt, return a dataframe containing when did each student make the nth attempt on the problem, and whether the attempt is correct or not.


===============Analysis Tools Currently Under Development=====================

CalcAssignmentCompletion: Given a list of problems (can either specify a certain identifier such as "problem_url", or can accept a data frame.) and a list of students (student_nid), output the total number of problems, attempted problems, and correct problems for each student. This is useful for questions such as "for those who finished x% on the homeowork, how many...."
	
	Difficulty: If the problem list contains problems that belong to AB experiment, then each student can only complete a fraction of the problems that they actually see. Need to determine the group assignment status of each student, then extract the problems that belonged to that group. Will develop that capability once the group assignment info can be extracted. 
	
Next Step: Takes a parameter "attempts", the default is {0,1}. 0 means last attempt, 1 means 1st attempt etc. (cannot get maximum attempt info from computed tables, and more than 1 attempt is less interesting)

outputs item/problem correct for each listed attempt. final correct number, 1st correct number, 2nd correct number etc...
