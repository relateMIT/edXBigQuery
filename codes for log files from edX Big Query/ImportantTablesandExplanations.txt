#The tables and descriptions

chapter_grades: each user's total points by (each) chapter. Use userid

course_axis: ordered course tree.

course_item: metadata for an item(input field), no student specific information.

person_item: contains when each student accessed each item, how many attemps and whether he/she is correct. Basically the response matrix. The time is presumably the problem access time, not very useful.

person_problem: very similar to the previous one. Maybe problems are graded and items includes both graded and ungraded?

problem_analysis: THIS IS THE USEFUL ONE! When does each student make each attempt to each problem, and what are the attempts. Use url_name to link back to course tree.

video_axis: video name, video_id for each video, as well as the chapter that it is in.

video_stats: (what's the difference between videos_viewed and videos watched?) The frequency of each video being viewed.

video_stats_day: I suspect that this is the day in which the student first accessed the video

person_course: A fairly silly thing is that many of the columns containing personal information are blank, such as roll.
