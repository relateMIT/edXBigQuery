================Proposed Analysis Tools Waiting To Be Developed=================

GetWhen.nthAttempt: Given a list of problems and a list of students, return a dataframe containing the time at which the nth attempt is made. (Note: whether the attempt is correct can be retrieved from the response matrix.)


GetCorrectWhen.OneStudent: Given one problem id and one student id, return a dataframe containing all the attempts the student made on this problem, whether it is correct or not and when each attempt was made.

GetCorrectWhen.OneProblem:  Given one problem id, a list of student ids, and specify the nth attempt, return a dataframe containing when did each student make the nth attempt on the problem, and whether the attempt is correct or not.


GetResources: Gets one or more types of resource (except for a problem) in a given course unit (chapter/sequential/vertical). Takes parameters: (chapter, sequence, vertical, type, courseAxis). chapter and sequences are display names, and vertical is the vertical number, and "types" is a list that contains all the resource types that are being extracted, such as {"video", "html"}. courseAxis is the courseAxis file.
